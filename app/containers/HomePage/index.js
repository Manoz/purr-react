        <p><Span secondary>purr</Span> <Span>react</Span> is a simple react
        boilerplate for simple apps without Redux. It features React,
        hot-reloading, react-router, ServiceWorker, styled-components and much more.</p>

        <p>There are a lot of react boilerplates everywhere but I&apos;ve never been
        able to find one that isn&apos;t too <em>overkill</em>.<br/>
        <A href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app" target="_blank">Create React App</A> is good for creating apps
        without build configuration but it completly hides the build config.
        You can <Code>eject</Code> the build config but you&apos;ll loose interest
        in using Create React App.</p>

        <p><Span secondary>purr</Span> <Span>react</Span> was designed to make
        the process of creating simple react apps easier without the need of redux
        or anything too overkill for a small project. You can extend the config as
        much as you want.</p>

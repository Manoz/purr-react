## ü§ñ Introduction

**purr react** is a simple boilerplate to build web application using React and Webpack. It comes with some good modern technologies like webpack-dev-server, eslint, babel... .

There are a lot of react boilerplates everywhere but I've never been able to find one that isn't too *overkill*. [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) is good for creating apps without build configuration but it completly hides the build config. You can `eject` the build config but you'll loose interest in using Create React App.

**purr-react** was designed to make the process of creating simple react apps easier without the need of redux or anything too overkill for a small project. You can extend the config as much as you want.

## üöé Features

1. **Easy as pie** - run one of the easiest React boilerplate without much knowledge
2. **Instant feedback** - hot reload your browser each time you save a file
3. **Automated production build** - `yarn build` or `npm run build` to build your app.
4. **Next gen JS** - want to write ES8? Do it! Webpack will make it es5 ready for you.
5. **Shiny styles** - use ES6 and CSS to style your app with styled-components üíÖ It will also improve performances by rendering only the styles that are on the pages.
6. **React routing** - `react-router-dom` will be your best friend to create your awesome `/about` page, thanks to routing.
7. **Improved cache** - your external project dependencies will be cached and service workers ready.
8. **Continuous Integration** - AppVeyor and TravisCI are ready to catch problems and will test everything on Unix and Windows.

This app also uses some good technologies:

* Babel
* ESlint (with the badass airbnb config)
* Jest
* stylelint
* npm scripts
* Webpack

## ‚òïÔ∏è Quick start

1. Clone this repo using `git clone https://github.com/Manoz/purr-react.git` and move to the directory: `cd purr-react`
2. Run `yarn setup` or `npm run setup` to start the setup process and install dependencies
3. Run `yarn start` or `npm run start` to see the demo app at *`http://localhost:3000`*
4. Run `yarn remove-demo` or `npm run remove-demo` to delete the demo app

If you don't want to use the setup script you can run `yarn install` or `npm install` after cloning the repo and keep everything in place.

Here is some additional commands you can also use:

* `yarn build` or `npm run build`: to build the production app inside the `*./build*` folder.
* `yarn test` or `npm run test` to test the built app

More information about the npm scripts can be found [here](https://github.com/Manoz/purr-react/tree/master/docs#npm-scripts).

## üìñ Documentation

The documentation for this project is not perfect for now but I'll add more content in the future and maybe a Wiki.

You can learn more about purr-react [here](./docs/README.md).

## ðŸ¤– Introduction

**purr react** is a simple boilerplate to build web application using React and Webpack. It comes with some good modern technologies like webpack-dev-server, eslint, babel... .

There are a lot of react boilerplates everywhere but I've never been able to find one that isn't too *overkill*. [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) is good for creating apps without build configuration but it completly hides the build config. You can `eject` the build config but you'll loose interest in using Create React App.

**purr-react** was designed to make the process of creating simple react apps easier without the need of redux or anything too overkill for a small project. You can extend the config as much as you want.
